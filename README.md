# Topogivity

This repository contains the code and data underlying the machine learning part of the paper "Topogivity: A Machine-Learned Chemical Rule for Discovering Topological Materials" (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03307).  If you find the code useful, please cite that paper.

The data in this repository originally comes from the Topological Materials Arsenal (https://ccmp.nju.edu.cn/).  If you make use of the data, please also cite the associated paper "Comprehensive search for topological materials using symmetry indicators" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0937-5).
